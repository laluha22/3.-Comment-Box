# 3.-Comment-Box

I made the comment box using the form element. The user sees the number of characters remaining (out of 140} for the comment as they type, with colour indication as the user reaches the limit ranging from orange when the user is almost at limit, to red when they are over the limit. I found some useful solutions to the script element on Stack overflow, specifically using if/else statement.
